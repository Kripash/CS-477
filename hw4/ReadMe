My function rearrange, rearranges a given array with the size to have the negatives on the left side of the array and the positives on the right side of the array after the function returns. 
The function sets a variable called replace_index to be 0. This is the idnex that is used to represent the array index in which the negatives elements will go. 
The function then traverses the size of the array and if the current element is smaller than 0 (negative) then it swaps it with the element in replace_index. Then replace_index is incremented so we do not swap negative lements with negative elements.
